<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Hi,</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is schanpsidee, a simulator applied to electrostatic content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Schnapsidee is open source and totally free, so you can contribute with this project on github.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step with this simulator is to familiarize yourself with the interface. So I recommend that you read this brief introduction and if you still have questions, you can consult the help menu <img class="img_help" src= "./assets/images/help.png"  alt="alt image" >, or access the project website <img class="img_world" src= "./assets/images/world.png"  alt="alt image" >.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also change the language of the simulator accessing the settings <img class="img_settings" src= "./assets/images/setts.png"  alt="alt image" >, in this menu it is also possible to insert Cartesian planes (xOy, yOz and xOz) for notion of measurements in the three-dimensional plane and the axes (x, y and z). In addition, the accuracy of the calculations can be adjusted up to 6 decimal places.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">First Simulation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can calculate the Electric Field, Force, Potential and Work with this simulator. Before calculating some of these variables, you must add an object (point, ring, line, or disk) and a proof charge (point in the space that you want to get the value to be calculated). To add these objects click on the menu&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #339966;"><strong>&nbsp; + &nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;and then add an object and a test charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an object and a proof charge you can perform the calculation of the available variables by clicking on the menu&nbsp;<strong><span style="background-color: #339966;"> { &nbsp;} </span></strong>&nbsp;. Note that after performing the calculation a box will be displayed next to the proof load, if you click on the box you can see the value of the vector coordinates or the value of the variable. When you calculate the electric field and force a vector will also be displayed alongside the test charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you can start electrostatic physics experiments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have fun!</p>
